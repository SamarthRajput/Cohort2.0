//adding default here basically means rather than import Dashboard like this
//import { Dashboard } from './components/Dash'
//I would import Dashboard like this 
//import Dashboard from './components/Dash'
//bcz the default export of that file is Dashboard now
export default function Dashboard(){
    return <div>
        Dashboard page
    </div>
}
