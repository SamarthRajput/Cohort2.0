//Ques => Explain more on how hashing and encryption are implemented on code level?
//there are famous algorithms for hashing and encryption (AES-128 , SHA-256)
//Library which provide function to implement alogorithms is cryptojs
//crypto.input("my string to encrypt").secret("saasa")

//Ques => High level difference between encryption and hashing is if you have todecode your data ever then you will use encryption
//if you dont want to decode it ever for eg passwords you store passwords in database you dont want anyone to decode the passwords we will use hashing


//Ques => Is there is a function to store anything in local storage is porvided by browser
// localStorage.setItem("asdasd" , "asdas")     setItem(key,value);
// localStorage.getItem("asdasd")
