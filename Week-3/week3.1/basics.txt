The use case of Middlewares is usually to do prechecks 
in real world prechecks are of 2 types
1. authentication 
2. input validation

query parameters -> whenever you are sending a get request a lot of times you can send an input along
for eg -  localhost:3000?n=30  this n is whats called an query parameter 

next is a function in itself which we can call if you think things are fine 
there are 3 inputs to a callback function 
1.req
2.res
3.next

In request we can send a range of callback functions
for eg - app.get("/" , cb1 , cb2 , cb3 , function(req ,res , next){
    
});


to install zod we will use command
command => npm install zod 


coercion -> to push someone to do something

we will use next auth for authentication
