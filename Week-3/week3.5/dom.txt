DOM -> Document Object Model
A standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTMl elements
DOM is not a programming language it is a programming interface for web documents

                    Document    
                        |
                       HTML
                       /  \
                     HEAD BODY
                      |   /  \
                   TITLE h1   p
                     |   |    |
         "my Document""header""Paragraph"

I want to access my heading <h1> i would write .document.body.h1 

.innerHTML is a method thats available which lets you change the text or change the content of a given element
