This is how authentication works in the real world
We hit chatgpt backend with email and password they give back a json web token(Jwt)
Now if we are sending any prompt along with the prompt you will send Jwt in the header
the backend will first verify the jwt if the Jwt is correct the backend will run the model and then returns a value

Jwt
1.Generate a jwt => the Backend server creates a very long string which is just called a jwt which if it ever comes back to the backend server it can verify it 
2. decoding a Jwt 
3. verifying a jwt

High level difference between Decoding and Verifying a Jwt
1. Inputs to both are same which is a string but the output here is ki han 
    verifying is only done by the backend server or the machine that have generated the original Jwt string
    but decoding anyone can do it
