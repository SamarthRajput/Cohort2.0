CRUD -> create read update delete

monogdb is schemaless

mongoose database library first tell me what is your schema then we can put whatever data we want to put in the database
we have to follow the schema mongoose library doesnt allow us to put something random in the monogdb database

Generally we have a strict schema only even though monogdb lets you do whatever schema you want put there generally
in your application you want a strict schema which is why people prefer SQL (Structured Query Language) ki its lets you inforce strict schema
but monogdb since it doesnot let you do it mongoose is actually gives you a benefit and makes your application more strict this is similar to the difference between TypeScript and JavaScript 

TypeScript provides you some typesafety on top of JavaScript
