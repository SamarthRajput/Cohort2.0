<!-- Problem statemnet Now you dont need calculate Sum button anytime someone type something the request should go out automatically  -->

<body>
    <!--  Anytime either this input changes or the another input changes you need to send the request and get back the response  -->
    <!-- Anytime an input changes which means someone put something call this populateDiv2() function -->
    <input oninput="debouncePopulateDiv()" type="text" placeholder="First Number" id="firstNumber">   <br></br>
    <input oninput="debouncePopulateDiv()" type="text" placeholder="Second Number" id="secondNumber">   <br></br>
    <!-- when i write 123 in input1 and 456 in input2 total 6 requests are going on. How can I optimize this slightly so that I dont send out 6 requests  -->
    <!-- one way to do it copy 123 seprately and paste it that way only 1 request went out  -->

        //which basically means ki you dont send out request immediately when you know you have  a use case like this where the user will slowly add inputs and you know you want to wait somewhere till the very end 
        //if the user hasnt typed for over 100miliseconds is when you want to send out the requests is known as debouncing or delayed sending out of request

        //debouncePopulateDiv() have to call populateDiv() if debouncePopulateDiv() hasnt been called for 100milliseconds
        //call happen to debouncePopulateDiv i will wait 100milliseconds if i dont get called again in 100milliseconds I will call populateDiv
        //but if I do get called in 100milliseconds then i will wait for more 100milliseconds

            //If debouncePopulateDiv() gets called start the clock but if debouncePopulateDiv() gets called again while this clock is running stop the original clock and restart a new clock
