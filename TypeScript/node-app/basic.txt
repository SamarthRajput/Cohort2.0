typescript is transfiled down to javascript 
if we a typescript file we can run a command to convert typescript file into javascript file 
We only convert typescript code into javascript code 
typescript compiler is supposed to ensure ke bhai there are no type errors in our code  

tsconfig.json contains a bunch of configurations ki how do you want to convert your typescript file to javascript file

our inputs/ typescript files should reside in src folder and our output should reside in dist/build folder
we put dist in .gitignore as dist the folder that is auto generated i should not push it to github 
we dont want to commit dist folder and nodemodules to the github

big difference between zod and typescript is 
zod is for runtime checks, zod runs when your code is actually executing on a browser in a nodejs
typescript is for compile time checks, typescript compilation type checks happen during compile time when your typescript code is converting to javascript code 


what is the difference between type and interface
interface you can extends in a class and type lets you do or's and and's (unions and intersections ) 

interfaces can be implemented by classes
we can use interfaces to extend

types let u do unions and intersections


interfaces and types lets us aggregate data together
