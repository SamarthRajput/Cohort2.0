Hooks were introduced bcz when you move from class based components to functional components then we need to 
1. worry about state  
2. worry about lifecycle events


LifeCycle events basically means events that can get triggered or some code you can run whenever a lifecycle of a component changes
whenever a component mounts which means first time the component get puts on the DOM or it unmounts whenever it gets put off the screen.

Anytime a state variable changes, anytime a hook refreshes the component will re render
